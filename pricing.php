          Custom website design means creating a website that is unique to your organisation. Your website is the
          face of your organisation and encapsulates your brand identity. Having a custom-built website will make
          you stand out from the crowd and allow you to portray your brand image the way you want to; it allows
          you to have consistency of your brand through your digital platforms. Every aspect of the website will
          be designed and built to your specifications, allowing you to manage the user experience from start to
          finish. Your custom website will also fully integrate with your existing systems, allowing seamless
          operation.

          <span class="title">Do you have any suggested page layouts for small bsiness website?</span>
          <i class="fas fa-plus"></i>
        </header>
        <p class="desc">
          <br>
          Yes, we do.
          <br>
          We’ve found that the following format is the most effective for small business websites. However, you
          can use this as a guide and add your personal touches to it.
          <br> <br>
          <b> Page 1: Home Page - </b>
          The homepage gives an overall summary of the services you offer, how you can help your customers and
          what makes your organization unique. It also includes links to your pages with more detailed information
          and your relevant industry accreditations.
          <br> <br>
          <b>Page 2: About Us - </b>
          This page includes a background of why and how your business was started, further detail about why your
          organisation is unique and what you have to offer potential customers that other businesses don’t.
          <br>
          <b>Page 3: Our Services - </b>
          This page not only describes your services but also describes how your services meet the needs of your
          customers.
          <br> <br>
          <b>Page 4: Portfolio/Gallery (Optional)</b> -
          This is a good way to show potential customers what you have to offer; they have a similar project to
          one that you’ve already completed, making it easier for them to relate. It’s also easier for people to
          relate to visuals rather than long text so this page is important when it comes to turning browsers into
          customers.
          <br> <br>
          <b> Page 5: Testimonials (Optional) - </b>
          Having actual customer testimonials is a good way to tell potential customers about the products and
          services you sell. If gives your offering credibility and makes potential customers feel at ease.

          <br> <br>
          <b>Page 6: FAQs or Fees/Price List (Optional) - </b>
          To avoid receiving the same query over and over from your customers, you can put together an FAQ page
          which addresses the most common queries your customers have.

          You can add a price list if your products have a set value or if you have packages that have a set cost.
          <br>
          <br>
          <b>Page 7: Contact - </b>
          This can include a map, contact phone numbers, e-mails and a contact form for users to submit any
          enquiries to you which will automatically be sent to your email.

          Only you know your industry and business inside out. So, whether you write your own content or you get
          us to do it for you, you will need to be heavily involved in this part of the process. You will need to
          provide vital information about the industry, your business, your customers, as well as any technical
          jargon that is industry specific.

          Whichever option you take, we will organise the content and structure it in a way that we see best fits
          the layout and design of the website.

          Knowing what you want at the start is key here. Having as much detail as possible about your
          requirements will assist us to provide you with a website design that meets all of your needs. Your
          availability (or lack of it) can have a large impact on the design process; we will need to be in
          regular contact with you. We also need the following from you at the start:
          <br><br>

          <b>Content:</b> Whether you’re writing the content yourself, or outsourcing it to us, we’ll need as
          much information upfront as possible. If we can’t get the
          content onto your website, we can’t go live, it’s as simple as that. <br> <b>Images:</b> If you have
          photos that you want to use, we’ll need these at the start. If you’re outsourcing that part to us,
          you’ll need to have an idea of the type of images you want.
          <br><br>

          <b>Other items:</b>
          We’ll require high quality logo images, links and other information that you want included on the site,
          at the start of the process. All of these aspects affect the layout and design of the website.
          <br>

      <div class="accordion-content">
        <header data-aos="fade-right">

          <i class="fas fa-plus"></i>
        </header>
        <p class="desc">
          <br>
          Yes. You can use images from your mobile or from any other source. However, if you want to portray a
          professional image to your potential and existing customers, we recommend that you use high quality
          images, whatever the source may be. Having low quality, pixelated images will make the whole website
          look cheap and unprofessional.
          <br>

        </header>
        <p class="desc">
          <br>
          Yes. All of our designed websites are based on a Google SEO foundation. We strongly follow Google SEO
          guidelines to ensure that your website will be highly ranked by Google, and will therefore increase the
          traffic to your site.
